## Search and get virtual numbers

Use different criteria to search and get virtual numbers for SMS, Voice or both. All countries where Sinch has numbers in inventory will be marked as **Direct Buy**. All other countries will require you to submit a request to Sinch for manual handling. 


#### Search virtual numbers

To manually search and get virtual numbers, [log in](https://dashboard.sinch.com/numbers/buy-numbers) to your dashboard. Then, go to Numbers > Get virtual numbers, fill in the required information and click **SEARCH**. Then, click **GET** for the virtual number you want to purchase.

If you want a random number selected, choose your country and just click **SEARCH**.

You can configure your number with a SMS, Voice and/or Campaign id (only for 10DLC numebrs) when you activate the number.

When you get a virtual number, if supporting documentation is needed, you will see a message in an orange box at the bottom of your form. You will not be able to get a virtual number until supporting documentation is submitted.


## Submit supporting documentation for virtual numbers

You can manage and create regulatory bundles, if needed, which are required to get certain types of virtual numbers in the US and virtual numbers in other countries. To create this bundle, go to **[Supporting Documentation](https://dashboard.sinch.com/numbers/supporting-documentation)**

As a US customer you will have 2 options, **IMPORT BUNDLE** or **NEW BUNDLE**. **IMPORT BUNDLE** is used if you already have registered a 10DLC brand in the TCR portal while **NEW BUNDLE** should be used if you need help from Sinch to create your brand registration. **NEW BUNDLE** is also the method to use if you would like to register a company outside the US to get virtual numbers.

### Import Bundle
Click **IMPORT BUNDLE** and create your import bundle request by giving the request a name. Then hit **CREATE**

In next step, add your already existing brand id and hit **NEXT**

A verification e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address registered within the TCR portal for that brand. You can either copy the code or click the e-mail link to complete the registration.

Often the bundle is approved instantly, but in some cases a manual approval is needed. If so, you will be notified via e-mail when the bundle is approved.
