## Receiving Incoming Calls via Push Notifications

To receive incoming calls via Push Notifications the _application instance_ has to be registered on the Sinch backend using [UserController.registerUser()](reference/index.html). Push Notifications allow reception of an incoming call even if the phone is locked, or the application is in the background or closed.
